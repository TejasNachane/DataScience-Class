    "2. Decision Tree can solved variety of Problems:\n",
    "3. It is considered as most understandble algorithm\n",
    "4. It is easily interpreted\n",
    "5. It can be used both Classification and Regression Problems\n",
    "6. Unlike most Machine Learning algorithm it efficiently work on non-linear data\n",
    "7. Constructing a Decision Tree is very quick process\n",
